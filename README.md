# Hi, I'm Lara Dharshini   

**Data Science Student** at **Coimbatore Institute of Technology**  
Coimbatore, India  

## About Me  

I’m a data science student with a growing passion for using data to design smart, scalable solutions that solve real problems. I’m driven by a simple curiosity: *How can data uncover patterns, inform decisions, and create outcomes that are more efficient, fair, and meaningful?*

This mindset has shaped my work across retail analytics, recommendation systems, and sustainability-focused applications.

I aim to become a data scientist who doesn’t just analyze data, but translates it into real value by blending machine learning, analytical thinking, and real-world context.

I’m currently seeking opportunities to learn, collaborate, and contribute to impactful, data-driven work.
